Ideas for future development (ideas only, no promises, tell me if you'd like anything else):
* display an explanatory text/link below the comment form, let the admin change this text in the options
* let the admin upload a different local default image
* check if not storing the checkbox value for spam comments works with other anti-spam plugins
* test the plugin with more themes (some common frameworks)
* search for further user photo plugins and check the interoperability
** "Simple Local Avatars"
* add automated tests
* just maybe: let users upload an image in their user profile
